# AllianceBook by David Nemes ðŸ‘‹  

AllianceBook is a simple **React Native** app that loads **Star Wars** characters, allowing users to **search** and **filter** them.  

## Project Setup  

This project was initialized using the **Expo** template: `blank-typescript`. It follows the **Atomic Design Methodology** for better component organization and maintainability.  

## Developer Notes  

Since [Star Wars Visual Guide](https://starwars-visualguide.com/) was not reachable, character avatars are being loaded from the alternative API: [Akabab's Star Wars API](https://akabab.github.io/starwars-api/api/).
